                <p>
                Parallax effects involve a website's background moving at a different speed than the foreground content. 
                This visual technique creates an illusion of depth which leads to a faux-3D effect upon scroll. 
                While parallax effects can make websites feel more interactive and engaging, 
                it's important to note that excessive movement within parallax effects can cause harm for those with vestibular disorders. 
                The illusion of movement and depth can cause dizziness or disorientation.
